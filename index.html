<h2>Crazy Cat Lady V2</h2>
<ul>


<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Experience a difficult action game feature projectile-physics based weaponry.  Players will have to weave through enemy attacks while also using their movement to affect a trajectory to hit their target.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Action
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Left and right arrows move character left and right, spacebar is jump, up is throw kitten.  Wipe out the invading alien force to win.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
My original idea for the crazy cat lady game was to make something somewhat reminiscent of Super Ghouls and Ghosts (despite never having played it myself), however I ran our of time to consider enemy AI and I had stumbled upon something simplistic that was still fun.  This time, though, I am returning to fulfill, to some extent, my original vision with enemies sporting multiple AIs.  I only wish that I had left myself time to come up with a unique movement algorithm for the boss.  Instead, it brings difficulty in its shooting pattern and ability to resurrect other aliens.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Projectile kitten weaponry.  Awesome chiptune music.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
Aliens have invaded your town; you must save your town with nothing but an army of kittens at your disposal (because who doesn't have an emergency box of kittens in case of alien invasion?)
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Fans of action games and those who always wanted to throw kittens at aliens.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Depending on the players skill, it could take several minutes.  The last level has some difficult jumps that give players some trouble.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Try to take out the aliens before they fire too many shots as dodging bullets can quickly get out of hand.
